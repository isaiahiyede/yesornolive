		        <a href="/">YesorNoLive.com</a> (or YESorNolive or YESorNo) is a <a href="/">news</a> prediction portal. Predictions made by registered users anticipate the outcomes of news stories in subject areas such as <a href="{% url 'general:getCategory' 'Entertainment-LifeStyle' %}">Entertainment & Lifestyle</a> , <a href="{% url 'general:getCategory' 'Sports' %}">Sports</a>, <a href="{% url 'general:getCategory' 'Politics' %}">Politics</a>, <a href="{% url 'general:getCategory' 'Business-Economy' %}">Business & Economy</a> and <a href="{% url 'general:getCategory' 'General' %}">General</a> topics.  In other words, a registered user predicts YES or NO on the outcome (in the near future) of a specific event and could either win or lose on the side of such prediction, based on eventual outcome of a news story. Essentially, therefore, all games or events on yesornolive.com are based on media/news reports. All games or events have been ‘pulled’ from the News. .

		        The question is in the title or headline. It may be a declarative statement 
		        (e.g ‘BUDGET Presentation: Education will get a bigger allocation than Health’), in which case you are expected to choose YES or NO. Sometimes, though, it may come in the form of a question (such as ‘ATLETICO MADRID VS QARABAG FK: Will Qarabag score at least a goal?’). Third, you should read content underneath the headline, in order to be properly guided in your choice of YES or NO. You may also click on any or all of the external links under ‘More Information’, to help determine your choice. Fourth, you need to type the amount you wish to stake and then, click on either YES or NO (depending on which side you choose). Lastly, click the PLAY button to finalize your prediction.

		        While each event has a deadline (or end date) for predictions to end, this does not mean the outcome of that event or prediction will be known on that day. The date mentioned on the event only serves to let predictors know when the doors are closed for predictions on that event.<br/>

				Usually, the eventual outcome of a predicted event is based on its outcome as published or broadcast by the mass media. Outcomes are always available in the public domain and immediately they are made available, our validators ensure such outcomes are also decided at YesOrNoLive. In the real sense, outcomes are not determined by the operators of YesOrNoLive, who only validate such outcomes. Outcomes are determined in the public domain. See our Terms of Use, to learn more.

Predictors stake a minimum of 25 Naira on a YES or NO position and can stake as many entries as possible (on either or both YES or NO positions), to increase their chances of winning. Three winners are selected by raffle, everyday, for a total prize of 25,000 naira (10,000 x 1 person AND 5,000 naira x 3 persons). Second is the Weekly Jackpot. The <a href="{% url 'gameplay:weeklyjackpot' %}">Weekly Jackpot</a> is based on a points system and everybody is qualified to participate, if they have accumulated 20 points during the week. Points can be earned, if a user updates their profile; makes a prediction during that week (whether the prediction is right or wrong); refers someone who registers as a new user on the site; someone they referred has made a prediction. Eleven (11) winners are selected at random for the Weekly Jackpot. While one (1) winner goes home with 50% of total winnings for that week, ten others share the remaining 50%. Total jackpot cash shareable per week varies and is a percentage of total amount staked by all predictors during the week.

		        Yes, you can. Outside the internal referral system which allows registered users to refer friends and earn points rewards which qualify them for jackpot, various opportunities exist for business-oriented, independent and freelance marketers to recruit new users for YesOrNoLive or help share predictions to others. These include:<br/>
				-Affiliate Media Partnership: for Blogs and Websites; TV, Radio & Newspaper channels with engaging online presence<br/>
				-Prediction Sponsorship: for personalities, professionals and celebrities who may wish to ‘sponsor’ certain predictions (subject to legal requirements, non-trespass and validation) related to their areas of expertise.<br/>
				-Social Media Partnership: for social media influencers with substantial following, who may want to share predictions published by YesOrNoLive to their followers.<br/>
				-Agents: for small and medium scale entrepreneurs who have hands-on experience in the lottery/gaming business and may want to expand, by including YesOrNoLive in their product basket. This is also suitable for young independents who have the requisite resources and acumen to succeed as YesOrNoLive agents.<br/>
				All enquiries for independent partnership should be directed to <a href="http://marketing@yesornolive.com/">marketing@yesornolive.com</a> with the subject INDEPENDENT PARTNERSHIP.
